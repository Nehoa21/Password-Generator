# Password-Generator

This project is my first in dabbling with Javascript. It has the ability to generate a random password any length between 8 and 127 characters long that can include any letter, both upper and lowercase, numbers, and most special characters. The user begins the process by starting the generator and a sequence of four window prompts will drop down with questions of what types of characters they want included. Afterwards the password will then be made randomly and will appear in the text box.

This was a tough project with it being my first with Javascript, so I had to use many resources to help out. I searched [MDN WebDocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) to more fully understand many concepts. I also just used [Google](https://www.google.com/) to find examples of those concepts to see how to they work and to incorporate them in my code.

Below is a screenshot of what the password generator looks like, and a link to it [here](https://nehoa21.github.io/Password-Generator/).
